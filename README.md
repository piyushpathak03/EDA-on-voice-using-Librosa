# Librosa

librosa is a python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.

## Installing Librosa:
I am using anaconda and had no trouble installing Librosa the following code as per the instructions from Librosaâ€™s documentation.
*conda install -c conda-forge librosa*

## Loading in a song:
Librosaâ€™s load function will read in the path to an audio file, and return a tuple with two items. The first item is an â€˜audio time seriesâ€™(type: array) corresponding to audio track. The second item in the tuple is the sampling rate that was used to process the audio. Eg:
import librosa
*data, sr = librosa.load('Heaven.mp3')*
